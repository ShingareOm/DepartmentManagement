### Project Scope: Department Management System

**1. User Roles and Authentication**
   - **Admin**: Manages the entire system, including adding new students, teachers, and managing courses.
   - **Teachers**: Manage class attendance, unit test marks, and communicate with students and parents.
   - **Students**: View their attendance, test marks, and receive notifications.
   - **Parents**: View their child's attendance and test marks, and receive notifications.

**2. Auto Attendance System**
   - **Attendance Marking**: Teachers can mark attendance via a web interface or integrate with an auto-attendance system (like RFID or facial recognition).
   - **Notification to Parents**: Automatically send SMS or email notifications to parents if a student is absent from the class. You can use third-party APIs like Twilio for SMS or SendGrid for emails.
   - **Daily Attendance Report**: Generate daily attendance reports for each class or department.

**3. Unit Test Marks Management**
   - **Marks Entry**: Teachers enter unit test marks for students in each subject.
   - **Average Calculation**: Automatically calculate the average of Unit Test 1 and Unit Test 2 marks.
   - **Notification to Parents**: Send the calculated average marks to parents via SMS or email.

**4. Academic Calendar Integration**
   - **Calendar Sync**: Integrate with the academic calendar to send reminders and notifications to teachers about entering marks or taking attendance.
   - **Exam and Assignment Scheduling**: Display upcoming unit tests, exams, and assignment due dates.

**5. Dashboard and Reporting**
   - **Admin Dashboard**: Provides an overview of attendance stats, test scores, and other key metrics.
   - **Teacher Dashboard**: Shows a summary of their classes, attendance records, and test scores.
   - **Student Dashboard**: Shows personal attendance records, test scores, and notifications.
   - **Parent Dashboard**: Allows parents to view their child's performance and receive notifications.

**6. Notifications and Alerts**
   - **Custom Notifications**: Teachers and admins can send custom notifications to students or parents.
   - **Automated Alerts**: Triggered based on predefined rules (e.g., attendance below a certain threshold).

**7. Additional Features**
   - **Performance Analytics**: Basic analytics to identify trends in student performance and attendance.
   - **Feedback System**: A feature for parents and students to provide feedback or raise concerns.
   - **Secure Data Handling**: Ensure all sensitive data, such as marks and contact information, is securely stored and transmitted.

**8. Technical Requirements**
   - **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js)
   - **Back-End**: Node.js with Express or Python with Django/Flask
   - **Database**: MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL
   - **APIs for Notifications**: Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (Email)
   - **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth

**9. Deployment and Maintenance**
   - Deploy on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
   - Set up regular backups and maintenance schedules.
